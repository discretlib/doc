*Discret* hides the complexity of peer to peer networks and reduces it to a data access problem. 

The API allows you to:
- manage your data using a GraphQL syntax,
- add access right to your data (in graphQL too),
- create and accept invites from other peers.

*Discret* will synchronize your data with other peers, depending on the access right you have given to those peers.
